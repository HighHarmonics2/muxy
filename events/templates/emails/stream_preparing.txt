Hi,

Your stream on "$event_name" starts in about $starts_in minutes!

Just in case, here's the info again:

* Starts at: $starts_at (UTC)
* Ends at: $ends_at (UTC)
* RTMP server: $rtmp_url
* Stream key: $key

We recommend that you start streaming $preparation_time minutes before the start
time, if you can, to ensure a smoothly transition.  Your stream will be
published to the event servers at the right time.

$support_channels_text

Have fun :-)
